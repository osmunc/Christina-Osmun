		<H1>Why the Move? </H1>
		<p>My husband (Kyle) and I have had a lot of fun travelling the world and working in different locations over the past 4 years but now we are looking for somewhere to put down roots. When Kyle received a phone call from a previous employer about a new role here in California, we couldn't say no. </p>
		<p>The final piece of the California move is for me to find meaningful work at a company where I can see myself having a long-term career.  </p>

		<H1>What I am Looking for in an Employer</H1>
		<p>Having experience across the world has provided me with a unique insight into what I want from a company and which companies will most benefit from me as an employee. My goal is to form a long term relationship with the next company I join. As a result, I will be selective about choosing companies that allow me to use my best skills and that can help me to developed them overtime in way that will be mutually beneficial.</p>
		<H1>Visa Status</H1>
		<p>I currently hold an L1 visa which allows me to legally live in the United States of America. I also have an Employment Authorization Card allowing me to lawfully work in the United States of America.</P>
