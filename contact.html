			<p>I was most recently employed by Deutsche Bank as a Liquidity Analyst in London, England. In this role I created a new process to report the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding ratio for the regulators. My team had little guidance on how to build this process. It was through our ability to prioritize, hard work and proactivity that we hit our deadlines. I used multiple techniques to analyze large datasets including: vlookups, pivot tables, and VBA (macro) coding.  I also created a database to track and record data from multiple sources which allowed in-depth analysis, prevented manual errors, decreased timelines and was a critical tool for problem spotting and solving. My strong verbal and written communication skills were used to explain the importance of timeliness and accuracy to many data providers across the bank and to keep stakeholders informed of progress and issues in the project.  </p>
			<p>For two years I worked for ASB Bank as a Treasury Analyst in Auckland, New Zealand. In this role I provided analytical support to the treasury management team. I created and maintained tools in Excel and SQL Management Studio. These programs were used for treasury operations and internal reporting to drive business decisions and insights. I communicated with management to understand and meet all requirements and deadlines and trained end users about the newly created tools and the underlying data. I used complicated SQL and VBA coding to create easy-to-use programs for complex data problems. In this role I also produced the Asset and Liabilities Report for the senior management team. Producing this report required strong communication skills as it explained complex treasury positions and strategies to people outside the treasury department. This position placed a high importance on self-motivation and attention to detail. </p>
